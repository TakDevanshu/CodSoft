Codsoft Internship - Weekly Tasks
Welcome to my Codsoft internship repository! Here, you'll find the results of my four-week internship, during which I completed a series of tasks aimed at enhancing my skills and contributing to the Codsoft project.

Week 1: NUMBER GAME
Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number. You can incorporate additional details as follows:
Limit the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
Add the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to play again.
Display the user's score, which can be based on the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

Week 2: STUDENT GRADE CALCULLATOR
Input: Take marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject. 
Calculate Total Marks: Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects. 
Calculate Average Percentage: Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage. 
Grade Calculation: Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved. 
Display Results: Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

Week 3: ATM INTERFACE
Create a class to represent the ATM machine.
Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().
Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.
Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.
Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions

Week 4: QUIZ APPLICATION
Quiz Questions and Options: Store quiz questions along with multiple-choice options and correct answers.
Question Display: Present one question at a time with multiple-choice options.
